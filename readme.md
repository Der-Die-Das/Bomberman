## Creating Tasks
To read about what a **Task** is in the **Hack'n'Plan** sense checkout their [documentation](https://hacknplan.com/knowledge-base/anatomy-of-a-task/).  

To create a new **Task** in **Hack'n'Plan** go to the **backlog** page, click on the ***Add item*** button and select **Task**.  

### Title
Try to give your new **task** a fitting name. For example:  
```
Player Movement
```
### Board
For the board you first choose **No board**. Later we can discuss when to work on what **task**.

## Description
In the description you write down what you want to be done in this task. Also describe how you want it to be achieved.

## Tags
Add the correct tag to it.  
```Player``` for stuff regarding the player. Like a new mechanic or a gameplay fix.  
```GameDev``` for stuff regarding the developer. A new developer plugin, or documentation.
### Assigned users
Clear the assigned user (yourself) from the list.  
Which user does what work is discussed later, when we pick up the task.

### Sub Tasks
You will want to add some **sub tasks** to the task to have smaller packets that you can work on.  
To do that select the ***Fields*** Dropdown on the top of the window and enable ***Subtasks***.

### Example

Here you see a example of a Task
