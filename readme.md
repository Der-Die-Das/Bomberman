## Creating User Stories
To read about what a **User Story** is in the **Hack'n'Plan** sense checkout their [documentation](https://hacknplan.com/knowledge-base/user-stories/).  

To create a **User Story** in **Hack'n'Plan** go to the **backlog** page you click on the ***Add item*** button and select **User Story**.  

### Title
After that you name it accordingly. Try to give it a fitting name. For example:  `NOT SURE YET. MAYBE USE TYPICAL USER STORY NAMING`  
Wrong:
```
Player can Move
```
Right:
```
Player Movement
```
### Board
For the board you first choose **No board**. Later we can discuss when to work on what **user stories**.

### Assigned users
Clear the assigned user (yourself) from the list.  
Which user does what work is also discussed later, when we pick up the story.
